In shadows deep, where whispers thrive,  
Amidst the dusk, where secrets dive,  
My soul, a vessel tossed at sea,  
Yearns for the shores of eternity.  

In mortal coils, we entwine and weave,  
Bound by fate, yet longing to cleave  
To realms beyond this earthly plane,  
Where time and space, no longer reign.  

Oh, let me chart the stars above,  
And drink from wisdom's ancient grove,      
Shall find their rest, their peace, aligned.
